# semver-releaser

This action provides a clean way to create SemVer 
releases based on Conventional Commits.

# Using this Action

This action relies on tags present on the repository, 
so it is required to unshallow the repository cloned by 
actions/checkout@v2:

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Prepare local repository
        run: git fetch --prune --unshallow --tags -f

     - name: semver-releaser
       uses: heyvito/semver-releaser@v0.0.7
       with:
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
